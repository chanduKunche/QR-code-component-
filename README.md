## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to design a UI card component using HTML5 and CSS. 

### Continued development

I still need to learn Flexboxes in CSS. The above card can also be built with Flexbox and Grid properties in CSS. But I need to learn them and can use in my future projects.
